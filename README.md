# Libft++, my ever evolving libft

Libft++ is my updated version of libft, building on what I learned from the original 42 project. It includes new features and improvements that Iâ€™m working on over time. This is not the same as the [Rank 00 libft](https://github.com/schardot/42_core/tree/main/rank00/libft), but rather a personal project that continues to grow and evolve.
